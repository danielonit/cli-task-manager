# CLI-Task-Manager
Simple task manager that was created with Python and runs in the CLI.

## Overview
I created this project because to-do list programs really help me be productive and I thought it'd be interesting to make my own that works in the CLI. My goals for this project were get more comfortable using the CLI, different libraries, and JSON files with my Python code. This is a really good offline solution for a to-do list app if you're somewhere without internet.

## Features
- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Add task statuses (to-do, in-progress, done)
- List all tasks or by status
- Delete all tasks at once
- Get the full list of commands using the help command

## Running the Project
To run the project just download the two files and you'll be good to go. Open the file in terminal, powershell, or whichever CLI you use. Run *python main.py (command)* to get started. To get the full list of commands, run *python main.py help*.
